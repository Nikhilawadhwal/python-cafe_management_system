# python-cafe_management_system
The Cafe Management System is a Python-based console application developed to simplify and automate the daily operations of a café. The system allows café staff to manage menu items, take customer orders, calculate bills, and handle basic order processing efficiently.

This project simulates a real-world café environment and demonstrates how programming can be used to solve practical business problems.
